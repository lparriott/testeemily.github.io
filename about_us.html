		<p class="body-text"> On May 22, 2010, a family of raccoons broke into our very old and dilapidated chicken coop and massacred our ladies. It was the next morning, as a family we moved the remaining ladies into smaller pens and immediate began extreme renovations on our chicken coop. We had an absolute blast. After our first successful build, naturally, our neighbors wanted to come over and see how it turned out and once the the visit was over, they wanted one too!  <br> <br> Ever since, our business has only grown and we've met backyard farmers all across the state. Watch this video to see a testimonial from one of our happy customers! (*disclaimer* this video is not a testimonial)  </p>
